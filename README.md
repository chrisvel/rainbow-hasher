### Install & Configuration

1. `Bundle install`
2. Edit main settings inside file of `main.rb`
3. Execute `ruby main.rb` and wait.

### How to Use?

**a. Configure Settings**

I will add comments when it's possible. Until then, `rs = Rainsolver.new("a", "z", 0, 9, 4)`
means that you want all possible and unique permutations including all alphabet
letters between "a" and "z", plus all numbers between 0 and 9 to create strings
of length 4.
